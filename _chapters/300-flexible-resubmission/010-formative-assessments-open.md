## Intent

Formative assessments are for learning and students should not be punished for
getting things wrong while learning.

## Problem

Students take courses with varying degrees of prior experience.  Those who
have  learned a subject previously are better equipped to succeed on weekly
assignments in a course.  Those who are brand new to a subject are still
learning how to put the pieces together and are more likely to make mistakes
as they learn material. 

Formative assessments should be an opportunity for students to interact with
new material and explore how everything fits together.  [Examples of formative
assessments could include weekly labs, weekly quizzes, practice programs, and
even certain exams.]  Making mistakes or failing to comprehend the complexity
of a subject are common situations and students should not be penalized for
these situations as the advance towards proficiency.  

Unfortunately, traditional grading models frequently grade weekly work based
on overall correctness and penalize students who are making legitimate
progress but have not yet progressed to mastery.


## Solution

Flexible grading of formative assessments can make grades more equitable
and improve/promote a growth mindset.

1. **Flexible Deadlines**:
   Traditionally, an initial deadline is announced for all formative 
   assessments.  Students who do not complete an activity prior to the
   initial deadline may be reminded that they have an outstanding activity.
   However, students are not penalized for missing initial deadlines and
   are actively encouraged to submit missing materials up until a "final"
   deadline which is often the end of the course but can be earlier for
   a variety of practical reasons.  However, the timeframe between
   "initial" and "final" deadline should be long enough to accomodate
   students who fall behind but make a legitimate effort to catch up.

2. **Multiple Attempts**:
   Formative assessments are about assessing progress on learning.  When
   done properly, such assessments should help a student identify lingering
   gaps in their knowledge or when activities are not completed in the way
   that is expected.  When such gaps/deficiencies are identified, students
   are encouraged to revise and resubmit until students get them "right."  

Assignments can be submitted for an initial assessment and may have
conditions in place before a redo/retake attempt is allowed.  However,
all are understood to be for learning purposes and thus should be open
for opportunities to further student learning by revisiting mistakes or
improving progress.


## Applicability

Revising and resubmitting material is more applicable when activities have
some element of creativity and/or personal style and narrative.  [code, short
answers, essays, etc.]  In these situations, considering why an answer is
wrong or insufficient involves more than learning the "correct" answer and
requires renewed effort (and learning) on the part of the students.

Allowing revisions and resubmissions may require additional effort on the
part of teaching personnel who must continue to grade an assignment over
multiple weeks and identify a method for being consistent about grades
assigned and feedback provided.  This can be challenging in large classes
or ones with significant variability in type and quality of allowed responses.


## How to Implement

1. Establish rules for HOW work--on-time first attempts, late first attempts,
   and  and revised work--will be submitted.
2. Establish a rubric or mechanism to help create consistency between
   various deliverables and their grades.
3. Identify if there conditions that must be met before revisions are
   allowed (Meeting with faculty or a TA, identifying how a submission
   has been changed, etc.)
4. Clearly explain rules to students.
5. Frequently encourage revisions.  [This may be a very new concept to
   students and they may need to be reminded it is an option].

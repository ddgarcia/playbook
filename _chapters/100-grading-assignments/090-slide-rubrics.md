## Intent

Grade students based on the movement they made up or down rubric levels rather than the
rubric level on which they end.


## Problem

Standard rubrics evaluate students based on current ability, but do not reflect growth over time. 


## Solution

The first assessment of a skill or outcome is evaluated as usual against a rubric. However, subsequent evaluations are based on a 'slide rubric', where grades are assigned based on movement from the past performance. 

For example, instead of assigning an assessment of "Proficient" a grade of B, one student could be given an A for moving up from "Partially proficient", while another could be given a C for moving down from "Advanced". 


## Applicability

This play works in a course with multiple rubric based assessments over time, where the main focus of evaluation is on growth as opposed to competency.


## How to Implement

In the first assessment of a skill, use a normal rubric (as an example consider a 4 point scale with the categories "Emerging", "Developing", "Proficient", "Advanced"). In subsequent evaluations, grades are assigned to rubrics based on previous performance. For example, the rubric for a student who scored "Developing", may award a C for "Developing", A for "Proficient" or "Advanced"; while the rubric for a student who scored "Proficient" may award a C for "Proficient" and and A for "Advanced". 

The final evaluation of a student is based on the final assessment, but that assessment is calibrated on a sliding scale based on the student's prior performance, so that points are awarded not just for achievement, but for demonstration of growth and improvement throughout the course.

As a concrete example taken from Mahmood 2019: The slide rubric for an assessemnt may set the cutoff for earning an A at "advanced" for those who scored proficient in a previous assessment, but at "proficient" for those who scored developing previously.

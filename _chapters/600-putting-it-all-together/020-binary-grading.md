## Intent

Use pass-fail grading and retakes to simplify grading and improve clarity for students.  

## Problem

Traditional points-based grading tends to be our least enjoyable activity in a course. 
Despite our best efforts creating and using rubrics, assigning partial points to partial learning,
we still find ourselves in dispute with learners over the grade we assign.
Our helpful feedback seems to be ignored or forgotten by the learner.

Learners also find the grading process frustrating, and often interpret a poor grade as a failure on their part, 
rather than a natural part of the learning process. 
They also tend to focus on how to _earn_ a grade, rather than how to _learn_. 

## Solution

This play consists of five practices, which combine to reduce the frustrations of grading for both us and the learners.
Most of the practices will not work well by themselves, but when used together,
provide a useful solution.

+ Pass/fail scoring
+ Retakes
+ Simplified grade calculation
+ Recommend a pace
+ Mixed assessment types

## Applicability

This play was implemented in three upper level undergraduate courses with enrollments of 
25-40 learners in each course. 
It has not been implemented in other settings to know if the level or 
enrollment of the course could impact its effectiveness.

## How to Implement

Details of each of the five play practices are provided here.

1.  **Pass/fail scoring:** Learner work is evaluated as satisfactory or unsatisfactory.
This provides for quicker assessment, as time is not required to determine partial points.
Detailed feedback is required to facilitate learning. 

2.  **Retakes:** In the absence of partial points, the option to redo an assignment is provided.
No limit on retakes is enforced, except for the end of the semester.
In-class activities (e.g. quizzes) are schedule outside of class with the instructor.
Other items are simply revised and submitted by the learner. 
Assessable items due at the end of the semester are not eligible for 
re-dos, due to the lack of time.

3.  **Simplified grade calculation:** Similar to Specifications Grading, 
a learner's course grade is based on how many assessed items earn a "complete."  

4. **Recommend a pace:** Due dates are provided for each assessable item,
but are not enforced, nor is there any penalty for a learner submitting work late.
This sets a pace for the learner, and provides guidance as the progress. 

A fifth practice, **Mixed assessment types**, can be used to improve binary grading, but may not
be strictly required to implement it. 
A given course can have a variety of assessment approaches.
For example, in-class quizzes, take-home projects, etc. 
Lower course grades can be earned by doing just one type of assessment, 
while higher grades require a variety of assessment types.
The types and quantity of assessment items can vary, based on the needs of the course.
Final exams can be graded using a typical point-based approach, 
with higher levels of points translating into higher quantities of completed items.

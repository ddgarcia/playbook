## Intent

To reform the previous Block Grading System, a norm-referenced approach, into a system that promotes transparency and cultivates a more inclusive, equitable learning environment by reducing competition and encouraging a growth mindset.

## Problem

The Block Grading System, designed to ensure consistent grades across sections and semesters in the sequence of Calculus courses, used a common final exam with a curve to maintain average final exam letter grade near departmental benchmarks. However, concerns arose, including lower benchmark averages for lower-numbered courses disadvantaging minority students, inconsistent experiences across sections, stress from unclear grades until the final exam, increased competition due to norm-referenced grading, decreasing sense-of-belonging and perceptions of grades being too low, and discouraging further STEM studies.

## Solution

The key grading and assessment changes being implemented by the source to make the grading system more inclusive, equitable, and supportive of student growth, while reducing competition and fostering a sense of belonging, particularly for students from historically underrepresented groups in STEM.
  + Mandatory Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory grading for certain courses with no letter grades and therefore eliminating curving of grades along with removal of midterm and final exams.
  + Increasing transparency in grading expectations and computation, which include explicit and binding weighting systems to all assessment categories, and decrease the impact of the final exam.
  + Efforts to reduce disparities in student experiences across sections. For example, the same faculty teaches two sections to make the student experience more consistent.
  + Shifting from high-stakes assessments toward formative and mastery-based grading, with a greater emphasis on student effort.
  + Experimenting with different grading options (e.g., offering students a choice between traditional grading or alternative grading systems with less emphasis on exams).
  + Continuing efforts to standardize in-class exams across sections to ensure more consistent experiences for students.
  + Reformatting class sizes and structures, such as creating a large lecture with smaller sections, to improve consistency in student experiences.
  + Participating in equity-focused initiatives, for example, joining an NSF-funded project to implement and investigate equity-focused changes in introductory math courses.



## Applicability

The grading and assessment changes described work best in large multi-section courses with diverse student populations, such as introductory multi-section Calculus sequence courses. 

It can also be implemented in STEM gatekeeping courses, where grading can impact students' decisions to continue their studies. For example, a mastery-based system can reduce dropout rates and stress.

Tradeoffs to consider:

Administrative and Logistical Complexity: Implementing mastery grading or eliminating curves may require substantial restructuring of assessment methods, additional faculty training, and increased coordination across sections.

Increased Faculty Workload: Mastery grading and formative assessments may require more time from instructors for individualized feedback and designing multiple assessment opportunities.

Scaling Challenges: These reforms may be easier to implement in smaller classes but harder to scale effectively in very large courses with limited instructional resources.


## How to Implement

Implementing the described grading policy changes in a large, multi-section course, such as a Calculus sequence, requires a structured, step-by-step approach with collaboration from instructors, administrators, and teaching assistants. 

The process, as noted by the source, is ongoing and incremental. Changes should be piloted gradually in a few sections or course levels (e.g., Calculus I), particularly in courses where students traditionally encounter more difficulties. Engaging instructors, teaching assistants, and students early on to gather real-time feedback about the impact of the practice will help refine the system before expanding it further.

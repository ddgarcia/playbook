# The Playbook of Equitable Grading Practices

Grading student work is a core aspect of education.
Traditional grading practices using points-based systems are ubiquitous,
where numeric scores representing individual assignment grades are combined
using variations of weighted averaging to determine an overall course grade.
However, educators are more frequently recognizing that such approaches may
have negative consequences.
As a result, educators are exploring alternative approaches to grading that
aim to address drawbacks of traditional practices.

Such approaches are often labeled *equitable grading practices* (EGP),
because they are less subject to the implicit biases embedded in
traditional grading practices. They also offer increased opportunities to
accommodate factors outside the classroom that can negatively affect
students, including work schedules, family life situations, or caretaker
roles. These factors can disproportionately affect students from
marginalized communities. By providing greater opportunities to reduce
the grading impact of such external factors, which have nothing to do with
content mastery or learning outcomes, such alternative practices can be
more "equitable."

However, educators interested in EGPs often do not know where to start or
how to adapt practices to their specific classroom situation. While many
educators would explore alternative grading if they knew how, lack of easy
access to clear descriptions of practical techniques is a significant
obstacle.
This situation is complicated by the fact that not all techniques work in
every situation, instead embodying trade-offs that require consideration,
with some being more advantageous for particular class sizes, or particular
learning tools, or particular course content, etc.

This **Playbook** collects practical *recipes* (or "plays") describing
specific grading practices instructors can choose to employ. It is organized
into chapters that are each centered around specific aspects of a course's
grading policy. Plays within a chapter aim to describe various practices
one might consider, including a discussion of the tradeoffs and an
explanation of how to apply the grading practice. Individual plays also
include a discussion area at the bottom where anyone in the community can
add their own experiences with the practice, ask questions, or further
develop ideas.
